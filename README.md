README
======

Turn your python code into native packages and ship faster.

Works with all packages on pypi. Works with open source projects
hosted on Github and Bitbucket.

Acts as an DEB/RPM repository. Add these package repositories
to your system one and start installing python packages
just like native packages. Boom.
